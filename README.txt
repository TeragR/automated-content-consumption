Automated Content Consumption is designed to keep track of all of the different streams of media that you want to enjoy. Podcasts, YouTube channels, web comics, blogs, and even books.
A media item is one piece of content, equivalent to one file. This could be a podcast episode, a YouTube video, or an online article. Every media item has a date associated with it (usually the day that it was published). Streams contain media items. A stream might be a particular blog, podcast, or YouTube channel. Categories contain streams. A category might be called something like "YouTube videos" or "Urgent". If you are just starting, you should create a category first, then put one or more streams in that category.
Categories are directories (folders) inside of the main content directory (defined as "CATEGORY\_DIR" in autoConCon.py). Streams are directories inside of categories. Every stream directory should have an info.txt file in it (created for you if you use the button to add a new stream), containing the type of the stream, the RSS feed for the stream (if it has one), and details about the media item that is at the front of the stream's queue.
There are three types of streams: downloaded, linked, and manual.
A downloaded stream is a list of locally saved files that this program goes through in order, from oldest to newest. The names of these files are assumed to have a particular format that includes the date that they were created / released on. A downloaded stream can have an RSS feed that downloads new files for you. Opening an item in a downloaded stream will tell the OS to open the file in whatever the default program is for that filetype. Completing an item in a downloaded stream does not delete the file; this must be done manually.
A linked stream does not store any media data locally. Instead, it is a list of URLs that are saved in the queue.txt files in its directory. It can still have an RSS feed to retrieve new URLs. Opening an item in a linked stream will open the URL in the default web browser.
A manual stream is what you should use for media items that are not files (that you have a copy of) nor URLs, but physical objects like books. If you want to add new items to a manual stream\'s queue, you have to edit its queue.txt file manually. It will still have a Complete button that can be used to move on to the next item. Manual streams do not have RSS functionality.
Automated Content Consumption is strongly based on the idea that media should be consumed chronologically. This is why only the oldest unconsumed item in each category is shown to the user. 
I have purposefully designed this program so that it is easy to see and understand (at least some of) its inner workings. The Python file that runs everything (autoConCon.py) is under a thousand lines, so hopefully it is easy to understand and navigate should you want to change something. The simplicity of the info.txt files means that you can change the current item in a stream or the RSS feed of a stream without launching this program.
